/**
 * The boundary has to be sharp in both directions.
 *
 * Too loose and Zack answers a legal or valuation question confidently and
 * wrongly, under the name of a licensed agent who then carries it.
 *
 * Too tight and Zack refuses ordinary product questions because they contain
 * the word "contract" or "value" — and an assistant that will not help with
 * routine work is worse than no assistant, because the operator stops asking.
 * The second failure is the more likely one, so most of these tests are about
 * what must NOT be refused.
