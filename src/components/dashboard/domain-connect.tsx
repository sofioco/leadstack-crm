 * — and every agent is in exactly one of them. `switching` is deliberately not
 * a peer: it answers a different question (which CRM are you leaving?), and
 * mixing the two axes into one row of choices is a large part of why this
 * screen read as convoluted. It now sits below the three doors as its own
 * thing.
 *
 * `migrate` was previously buried as a sub-choice inside `existing` — an agent
 * had to pick "I have a website", then discover a second keep-or-move
 * question. Moving it up means the agent answers once and only sees the path
 * they chose.

 * list covered 9, so half the platforms rendered a button reading "Launch
 * your current host" instead of naming where it went. Keeping both on one
 * record makes that class of drift impossible — adding a platform to
 * `BusinessSourcePlatform` fails the build here until both halves exist.
 *
 * `dashboardUrl: null` means we have no dashboard to send them to and the
 * Launch button is not rendered.
 *
 * `pickable` marks the platforms offered in the "who hosts your site?"
 * picker. The others can still arrive as a `sourcePlatform` from onboarding
 * (where the question is which platform the BUSINESS runs on, not who hosts
 * the site) — they need a label for the button even though they are not
